# Linux Commands & DevOps Bootcamp - Comprehensive Notes

## Introduction
- The video provides an introduction to Linux commands and their importance in a DevOps boot camp.
- Covers terminal basics, shell scripting, practical applications, and commonly used commands.
- Encourages hands-on learning and documentation through blogging.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Practical Learning Approach
- Focuses on hands-on experience over theoretical knowledge.
- Encourages learners to engage with real projects to improve skills.

### 2. Understanding the Shell & Commands
- Shell: A command-line interface to interact with the operating system.
- Commands executed in the shell allow users to manage files, directories, and processes.
- Essential commands:
  - `echo "Hello, World!"` – Print text to the terminal.
  - `whoami` – Display the current user.
  - `uname -a` – Show system information.
  - `man <command>` – Show the manual page for a command.
  - `exit` – Close the terminal session.

### 3. Navigating the Terminal
- Moving between directories and managing files effectively.
- Commands:
  - `pwd` – Print the current working directory.
  - `ls` – List files in a directory.
  - `cd <directory>` – Change the directory.
  - `cd ..` – Move up one level in the directory.
  - `ls -l` – Detailed list of files with permissions.

### 4. File Management
- Managing files and directories using the terminal.
- Commands:
  - `mkdir <directory>` – Create a new directory.
  - `touch <file>` – Create a new file.
  - `cp <source> <destination>` – Copy files or directories.
  - `mv <source> <destination>` – Move or rename files.
  - `rm <file>` – Remove files.
  - `rm -r <directory>` – Remove directories recursively.

### 5. Environment Variables
- Role of environment variables in system configurations.
- Commands:
  - `echo $PATH` – Show directories where executable files are stored.
  - `export VAR=value` – Set an environment variable.
  - `unset VAR` – Remove an environment variable.
  - `env` – Display all environment variables.

### 6. Command Redirection & Piping
- Managing output and automating tasks.
- Commands:
  - `>` – Redirect output to a file (overwrite).
  - `>>` – Append output to a file.
  - `<` – Take input from a file.
  - `|` – Pipe output from one command as input to another.
  - `grep <pattern> <file>` – Search for a pattern in a file.
  - `sort <file>` – Sort file contents.

### 7. Monitoring System Resources
- Tracking system performance and disk usage.
- Commands:
  - `top` – Display running processes and system resource usage.
  - `htop` – Interactive process monitoring.
  - `ps aux` – Show all running processes.
  - `df -h` – Show disk space usage in human-readable format.
  - `du -sh <directory>` – Show the size of a directory.
  - `free -h` – Display memory usage.

### 8. Basic Scripting with Bash
- Automating repetitive tasks using shell scripts.
- Steps:
  1. Create a script file: `nano script.sh`
  2. Add shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
  3. Write commands inside the script.
  4. Save and exit.
  5. Give execute permission: `chmod +x script.sh`
  6. Run the script: `./script.sh`
