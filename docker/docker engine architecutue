ðŸŒŠ Docker Engine Architecture:
Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that provides containerization services. It follows a client-server architecture.

ðŸ§© Components of Docker Engine:
Docker Client (CLI):
Interface for users to interact with Docker.
Commands like docker build, docker run, docker push, etc.
Sends requests to the Docker Daemon using REST API.

Docker Daemon (Server):
The background process running on the host.
Handles building, running, and managing Docker containers.
Listens to Docker API requests.

Docker Host:
The system where Docker Daemon runs.
Contains Docker Daemon, Containers, and Images.
Manages resources like CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage.

Docker Registry:
A storage location for Docker Images.
Public Registry: Docker Hub.
Private Registry: Custom registries for security and performance.

Docker Objects:
    Images: Read-only templates used to create containers.
    Containers: Isolated applications created from images.
    Networks: Manages container communication.
    Volumes: Persistent data storage for containers.
ðŸ”„ Workflow (How It Works):
Docker Client sends a command to the Docker Daemon.
Docker Daemon processes the command and interacts with:
Images (via Registries) - Pulls images if not available locally.
Containers - Creates and manages containers.
Networks & Volumes - Manages networking and data persistence.
Docker Daemon sends the output back to the Client.
